# Unexpected sephora!
You walk through Sephora and look at all the aisles.  You noticed all the TikTok viral products, from Drunk Elephant all the way to Summer Fridays.  It didn't matter though since you got all of those products and more.  You ended up going through the Rare Beauty section and...

OH MY GOSH!  They have the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush in the shade you've been looking for!! "Joy"!!
However, you don't have any money, you silly goose, so you decide to do something devious.
