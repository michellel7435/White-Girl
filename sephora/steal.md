# Snitches
You walk through Sephora and look at all the aisles.
OH MY GOSH!  They have the Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush in the shade you've been looking for!! "Joy"!!
However, you don't have any money, you silly goose, so you decide to do something devious.
You.
Stole.
It.

BUT!!  An old white lady, probably a Karen, saw you taking it, she immediately yelled at you, embarassing you in front of everybody.  You were so mad, you threw a victim tantrum.  Unfortunatley, you were banned from that Sephora and got arrested.  You must hate that lady huh.  Should you stay in jail or escape?
