# Suprise suprise customer!

When you entered Claires, you were hoping that the things you wanted had that 40% off deal, but as soon as you walk in, confetti started to rain on you!!

Turns out you were the millionth member in Claires. You were given 30 minutes to get whatever you want for free, thank goodness, you only had 10 dollars. You got everything you wanted, you even made a little girl cry for taking the flowercrown she wanted, it looks better on you anyway.

You went back home with 3 bags in each of your hands, your happiness made you forget about the pain of lifting those bags.
