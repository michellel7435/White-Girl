# Are you fast enough?

Ironically, **you ran away**, this is the first time you ran since you're the type of girl to walk in a group while doing laps in gym.  Never knew how fast you could be.

You made it back home but now there is **posters of you being wanted**, it was a bad photo of you too, made your nose look ten times bigger. **Your dad found out got so mad and grounded you because you made your family reputation worst.**

Still don't have that blush though.
