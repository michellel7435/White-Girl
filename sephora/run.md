# Are you fast enough?

Ironically, you ran away, this is the first time you ran since you're the type of girl to walk in a group while doing laps in gym.  Never knew how fast you could be.

You made it back home but now there is posters of you being wanted, it was a bad photo of you too, made your nose look ten times bigger. Your dad found out got so mad and grounded you because you made your family reputation worst.

Still don't have that blush though.
