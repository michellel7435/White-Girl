# Phew..

You looked at the product and threw it out.

It doesn't matter anyway, it wasn't *your* money.

You just deicded to put on a pimple patch and just continued to explore the house.  After 8 hours of doing absolutley nothing, you took off your pimple patch and washed your face.

Yay!! The pimples are gone now and your skin looks more clearer than ever!!

[Ending: Even though it was a boring day, at least you don't look ugly!!](../wake-up/wake-up.md)
