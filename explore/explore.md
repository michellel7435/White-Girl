# Sweet, Jackpot!
While looking through all the super goldy rich stuff, you stumble upon a huge box behind a picture frame.

You then remembered that this is where dad keeps all his super duper awesome expensive stuff, they're kind of ugly though.

You look to the right and you see a bunch of money, hundreds, fiftys, and some twenties, mostly hundreds, (oh my gosh girl you're so rich).  You take the money because, like, duh.

YAY!! You now are considereed the richest girl in the country!

But... it is kind of selfish to steal from dad, I mean, he is your dad after all.  Buttttt... you could also be the richest girl in the country.
