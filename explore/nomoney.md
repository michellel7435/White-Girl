# There's gotta be something else I could do.

Even though it HURT to ignore all that nice clean juicy money..., you went back to your room and sat on your fluffy chair in front of your vanity.

You looked at all your make up products, skincare, all the stuff you don't need but wanted and, wait...

You looked at the mirror...

You realized that your skin IS BREAKING OUT!?!?!?

You immediatley went to the bathroom to wash your face and try a new skincare product you bought

**AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution** from the Ordinary.

You heard some bad things about it but it is a popular product.  Should you use it?
