# Would sorry fix it all?

<<<<<<< HEAD
You decided to apologize for stealing the money but your dad did not accept the apology. 

[No more backing up](../explore/grounded.md)
=======
You walked back to your room and started to pace back and forth, thinking of an apology.  While pacing, dad came back home and he sounded FURIOUS.  You started to get worried and began to tear up.  Dad opens the door and begins to yell at you, but mid sentence, you apologized??  What??
You never apologized, like ever, this was a mind opening experience for your dad since you're so snobby and selfish.
Dad looked at your watery eyes and just sighed, he told you to never do it again, and if you did, you would be grounded.  Once he left the room, you felt something you never felt before.  Was it sadness?  Was it madness?  Are you going insane!?  No, you finally felt sorry for your dad and for the first time in your life, you felt bad.
You just began to think about the decision you made, you made a promise to yourself you would never ever ever EVER steal again.  For sure this time.
