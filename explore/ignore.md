# The consequences of ignoring a big paycheck ..

Whatever!  Dad has enough money anyway, it wouldn't hurt to take some.  You went back to your room and began to think of all the wonderful things you can buy.  While imagining about going to Lululemon, dad came back home and he sounded FURIOUS.  You jumped out of fear and began to panic, trying to think of an excuse but it was too late!  Dad opens the door and begins to yell at you!!  After all the yelling and crying, you were officially grounded!
