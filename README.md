# White Girl Trip

# CYOA

### Purpose

The purpose of this the partnered project is to use our knowledge of Git and Github to make our own creative adventure. This was also to work on collaboration with each other and testing our skills. We had to make files with choices that leads us to a different scenario/outcome to tell our story. Our story is about waking up into a stereotypical white girl life where you have many options that lead to a bad outcome and a little option where it leads to a positive outcome.
